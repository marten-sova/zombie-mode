Interactive voice assistant built with Google's Dialogflow

Have you ever felt so tired after a long day that you don't have the energy to do anything but stare at the wall?

This is a voice user interface app that helps you figure out a good use of your free time when you're in zombie mode. (The embedded demo is text-chat only, but it's still fun to play around with.)

Here are some sample phrases if you'd like to try it out:
I'm tired after a long day and I don't know what to do.
It sure is nice out...
I should probably get back into my hobbies, huh?

# Details 

This voice application, Zombie Mode Decision Maker, addresses a long term problem I have observed in myself and others, often as a result of overwhelming school or work responsibilities.

Your brain has a *decision-making battery* that is only recharged while sleeping. After a certain amount of decisions, especially those that require critical thinking or similar executive function, the ability to make decisions and exercise self-control is significantly degraded.
One simple demonstration of this concept of decision fatigue is the tendency for consumers to make increasingly poor choices in a supermarket as each food item requires scanning through multiple options and choosing the best one.

After a productive day, decision fatigue is in full effect, and selecting an interesting activity to spend your leisure time on becomes impossible. We colloquially call this zombie mode.A zombie doesn't see the point of engaging in their many interests, doesn't want to plan an outing with friends, and doesn't even want to find a new movie to watch. The zombie isn't incapable of happiness, they just are unable to initiate any steps toward it.

Enter the Zombie Mode Decision Maker. This app has a pool of your favorite activities, with a focus on the enriching ones. It asks a few questions to determine your current zombie level and other soft variables, then chooses an appropriate activity for you to do.
